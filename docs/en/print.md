# Documentation for print.py

## Overview

The `print.py` script is an in-progress module designed for printing images through printers configured on the CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) server. It leverages the `cups` Python module to interface with CUPS, providing functionalities to select printers and manage print jobs, specifically tailored for image printing.

## Dependencies

- **External Modules**: `cups` (requires the CUPS system and its Python bindings to be installed and configured on the host system).

## Key Functionality

### Print Image

The core functionality of the script is encapsulated in the `print_image` function, which performs the following steps:

1. Establishes a connection to the CUPS server.
2. Retrieves and lists available printers, offering a basic check to ensure the specified printer is accessible.
3. Submits an image file for printing on the specified printer, generating a print job ID for reference.

### Error Handling

The function includes minimal error handling to notify the user if the specified printer is not found, listing all available printers as part of the error message to aid in troubleshooting.

## Example Usage

The script contains an example usage section that demonstrates how to call the `print_image` function with hardcoded values for the printer name and image path. This example serves as a basic guide for integrating the printing functionality into broader application workflows.

```python
printer_name = "Your_Printer_Name_Here"
image_directory = "/path/to/image/directory"
image_file = "example.jpg"

image_path = os.path.join(image_directory, image_file)
print_image(printer_name, image_path)
```

## Considerations for Further Development

Given the script's in-progress status, several areas could be considered for further development:

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling and feedback mechanisms to manage common printing issues, such as printer connectivity, file format compatibility, and print job status monitoring.
- **Configuration and Flexibility:** Extend the function to include more print job options, such as print quality, paper size, and orientation, allowing for greater customization based on user needs or specific application requirements.
- **Integration with Application Workflows:** Consider how the script will integrate with other application components, especially in contexts requiring batch printing, print job scheduling, or user interaction for printer selection.

## Installation and Configuration

Ensure that the **CUPS system** is installed and properly configured on your host system, including the installation of necessary printer drivers. The cups Python module should also be installed (**pip install pycups**).



### Installing Required Dependencies on eg. Raspberry Pi:

To use pycups on your Raspberry Pi, you need to ensure that the required dependencies are installed. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Update Your System**: Ensure your package lists and installed packages are up to date.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade

This will ensure that your Raspberry Pi is running the latest software.

**Install CUPS and Development Tools**: Install CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System), the CUPS development libraries, and the Python development headers. These libraries are essential for compiling pycups.


    sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev libcupsimage2-dev gcc python3-dev

This command installs the necessary libraries and development tools.

Install pycups Using pip: After installing the necessary development packages, try installing pycups again using pip3.

    pip3 install pycups

By now, you should be able to successfully compile and install pycups.

Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel (If Needed): In some cases, you may need to ensure that your pip, setuptools, and wheel packages are up to date.

    pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

After upgrading these packages, attempt to install pycups again.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process or if you have error messages, please provide them for further assistance.
