# Documentation for app.py
# Overview 

`app.py` serves as a pivotal module in the application, orchestrating the user interface and facilitating user interactions. This module leverages the powerful PyQt5 framework to build a robust and responsive graphical user interface (GUI), making it a central piece for applications requiring user interaction through a visual interface.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `app.py` is to define the structure and behavior of the application's GUI. It encapsulates the design and functionality of various UI components, including windows, widgets, layouts, and event handlers, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Scope

Within `app.py`, you'll find definitions for key classes and functions that collectively build up the application's front-end. This includes:

- **AppState**: A class designed for managing the application's state, allowing for dynamic updates and interactions within the GUI.
- **VendingMachineDisplay**: A custom `QWidget` subclass that acts as the main container for the application's UI elements, organizing them into a coherent and functional layout.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: `app.py` follows a modular approach, separating concerns between state management and UI presentation, which facilitates maintainability and scalability.
- **State-Driven UI**: The application's UI dynamically responds to changes in application state, providing a reactive user experience that updates in real time to reflect the current context and data.
- **Integration with PyQt5**: By utilizing PyQt5, `app.py` leverages a comprehensive set of tools and widgets for creating professional-grade GUIs, including support for multimedia components, event handling, and custom widget styling.

## Usage

Developers working with `app.py` can expect to interact with high-level abstractions for UI components, straightforward mechanisms for state management, and event-driven programming patterns. This module is typically invoked as part of the application's startup process, initializing the GUI and binding it to the underlying logic and data models.


# AppState Class Documentation

## Overview

The `AppState` class, defined within `app.py`, is a fundamental component designed for managing the application's state and enabling inter-component communication in a Qt-based GUI application. It inherits from `QObject` to utilize Qt's signal-slot mechanism, making it suitable for applications that require dynamic responses to state changes.

## Dependencies

- **Qt Modules**: `QObject`, `pyqtSignal` from PyQt5.QtCore

## Features

- **State Management**: Centralizes the management of the application's state, providing a single source of truth for the state-related logic.
- **Signal Emission**: Employs Qt's signal mechanism (`pyqtSignal`) to emit events when the application's state changes, allowing other components to react to these changes in a decoupled manner.

## Class Definition

### Properties

- `state`: A property that encapsulates the application's current state. Access to this property is controlled through a getter and a setter to ensure that state changes are managed consistently.

### Signals

- `stateChanged(str)`: A signal emitted whenever the state changes, carrying the new state value as a string. This signal can be connected to slots or functions within other components, enabling them to respond to state changes.

## Usage

The `AppState` class is typically instantiated once and used throughout the application to manage and observe the application's state. Components that need to respond to state changes can connect their slots or functions to the `stateChanged` signal.

### Example

```python
# Instantiation
app_state = AppState()

# Connect a function to the stateChanged signal
def on_state_changed(new_state):
    print(f"Application state changed to: {new_state}")

app_state.stateChanged.connect(on_state_changed)

# Update the state
app_state.state = "1"  # This will emit the stateChanged signal and invoke on_state_changed
```

### Considerations

The AppState class is designed to be integrated into a Qt-based application. Ensure that the Qt event loop is running to enable signal-slot communication.
The class currently manages a simple string-based state. 
# VendingMachineDisplay Class Documentation

## Overview

The `VendingMachineDisplay` class, defined within `app.py`, is a crucial component of the application's graphical user interface (GUI). It inherits from `QWidget`, making it a versatile container for various UI elements. This class is primarily responsible for constructing and managing the layout, controls, and other visual elements that constitute the application's user interface.

## Dependencies

- **Qt Widgets**: Inherits from `QWidget` and may use other widgets such as `QLabel`, `QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout` from PyQt5.QtWidgets.
- **Qt Multimedia**: Potentially uses `QCamera`, `QCameraViewfinder` from PyQt5.QtMultimedia and `QCameraViewfinder` from PyQt5.QtMultimediaWidgets for camera integration.
- **Qt Core**: Utilizes classes like `QPixmap`, `QMovie` from PyQt5.QtGui, and `Qt`, `QSize`, `QRect`, `QPoint` from PyQt5.QtCore for core GUI functionalities.

## Features

- **Layout Management**: Manages the arrangement of UI elements using layouts (e.g., `QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`), ensuring a responsive and organized display.
- **State Integration**: Integrates with the `AppState` class to reflect and potentially modify the application's state based on user interactions or other events.
- **Multimedia Support**: If camera functionality is used, it may include features like live camera feed display, utilizing `QCamera` and `QCameraViewfinder`.

## Class Definition

### Constructor

- `__init__(self, appState)`: Initializes a new instance of the `VendingMachineDisplay` class, taking an `AppState` object as an argument to facilitate state management and interaction.

### Key Methods

- The class includes methods to initialize UI components, set up layouts, and connect signals to slots for event handling (e.g., button clicks, state changes).

## Usage

The `VendingMachineDisplay` class is instantiated as part of the application's GUI setup process, often in the main script or a dedicated GUI module. It requires an `AppState` instance to allow for state-based UI updates and interactions.

### Example

```python
app = QApplication(sys.argv)
app_state = AppState()
vending_machine_display = VendingMachineDisplay(app_state)
vending_machine_display.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

### Considerations

Ensure that the AppState object is properly initialized and passed to the VendingMachineDisplay constructor to enable state-based functionality.
